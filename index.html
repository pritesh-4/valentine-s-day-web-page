    <h2>What Valentine Truly Means</h2>
    <p>
        Valentine’s Day is often misunderstood as something loud or flashy.
        In reality, it is gentle. It is about acknowledging presence,
        effort, understanding, and emotional honesty.
        <br><br>
        It is about appreciating someone not for perfection,
        but for sincerity — for the way they care,
        listen, and exist in your life.

    <h2>Gratitude</h2>
    <p class="long-text">
        Gratitude does not always need grand gestures.
        Sometimes it lives quietly in words unsaid,
        in moments remembered, and in feelings felt deeply.
        <br><br>
        This page exists to say thank you —
        for patience, for empathy, for staying kind in a world
        that often forgets how important that is.

    <h2>Soft Moments</h2>
    <p>
        Not all memories need to be loud.
        Some moments stay with us because of how they felt —
        calm conversations, shared silence,
        gentle laughter, and mutual understanding.
