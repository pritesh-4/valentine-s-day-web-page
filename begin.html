    <h1>Before You Read Further</h1>
    <p>
        This page is not meant to impress.
        It is meant to be felt.
        <br><br>
        Read it slowly —
        like a quiet conversation,
        not a performance.
    </p>
</section>

<section class="letter">
    <p>
        There are people who change our lives loudly,
        and then there are people who change us softly.
        <br><br>
        The soft ones stay longer.
        They don’t rush.
        They don’t demand.
        They simply exist —
        with warmth, patience, and understanding.
        <br><br>
        This page is for that kind of presence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Appreciation isn’t about perfect words.
        It’s about honesty.
        It’s about noticing the small things —
        the way someone listens,
        the way they care without asking,
        the way they make space for others.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some people make life feel less heavy.
        They remind us that gentleness
        is not weakness,
        and that love doesn’t always need to be loud
        to be real.

        <h3>🌸 Softness</h3>
        <p>
            Softness is choosing kindness
            even when the world feels sharp.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>💗 Care</h3>
        <p>
            Care is showing up —
            not only in joy,
            but also in silence.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>🌙 Understanding</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding is listening
            without needing to fix.
        </p>

        If you feel calm while reading this,
        then this page has done its job.
        <br><br>
        Happy Valentine’s Day.
        <br>
        You are appreciated — quietly, sincerely.
